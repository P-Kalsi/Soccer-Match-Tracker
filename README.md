# My Personal Project

## Soccer Match Tracker
This java application will allow 
users who enjoy the
sport of soccer/football to track their
favourite matches, leagues, and tournaments
in a simple method to manage their schedule.
This project is of great interest of me as it combines my passion for software
development alongside my love for sports. 
Designing this would not only benefit me, but would provide me a way to contribute to the soccer community
I am a part of.

## How to use
Downloading the folder from the repository, you can run the project in your preferred IDE with Java installed. There is an option for a GUI environment or UI which you select by either entering 1 or 2 in the terminal. From there 6 options will be available:
- View match details
- Add a match
- View tracked matches
- Remove a match
- load matches
- Save matches


### View Match details
Pressing 1 at this menu or clicking the 'View match details' button in the GUI allows you to view statistics of the match you have selected to observe, such as goals scored by a player, cards given to an individual, the teams that are playing and assists given by and given to. Goals, cards and assists also display exactly what minute they were done.

### Add a match
Adding a match is done by pressing 2 or clicking the 'Add a match' button in the GUI, where you will provide details such as team names, goals scored by who, card given to who, and assists by who (all with exact minutes).
