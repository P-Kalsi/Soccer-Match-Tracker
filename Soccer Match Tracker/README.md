# My Personal Project

## Soccer Match Tracker
This java application will allow 
users who enjoy the
sport of soccer/football to track their
favourite matches, leagues, and tournaments
in a simple method to manage their schedule.
This project is of great interest of me as it combines my passion for software
development alongside my love for sports. 
Designing this would not only benefit me, but would provide me a way to contribute to the soccer community
I am a part of.

User Stories:
- As a user, I want to view a list of upcoming soccer matches
- As a user, I want to view match details including goals, assists, and cards
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a match from my tracker
- As a user, I want to be able to add a soccer match to my match tracker
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of soccer matches in my match tracker
- As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save my to-do list to file and have the option to do so or not.
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my to-do list from file.

## Instructions for Grader
- The user can generate the first required action user story
  "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by pressing the add match button
  located at the bottom of the displayed panel
- The user can generate the second required action user story
  "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by pressing the add match button
  located at the bottom of the displayed panel and after filling
  out the date and teams, one can choose to add the amount of goals, assists, or 
  cards for the tracked game.

## Phase 4: Task 3
Looking at the overall design of my project
a lot of it could have been encased within in a few classes 
rather than the 8 classes I made for little things (ex. the class
'Team' could have been just a string). Losing these 
extra classes would make the overall code more cohesive and eliminate any
useless data that would just take up unnecessary storage. Refactoring them
I would probably get it down to about 3 classes if I did have more time
to go back and polish my work.
Nonetheless, I did put these
classes there in case I wanted to expand on my project by using
data sets to record real-time rosters for better usage of the app instead
of manually inputting names of players.
